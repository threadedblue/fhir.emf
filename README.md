# fhir.emf

## This project is a full implemtation of the FHIR 4.0.1 specification built using EMF (eclipse modeling framework).  
&nbsp;

This project is intended to be used as a data model.  A likely use case might be as the model component of a webservice.  
&nbsp;

Because this is a full, complete implementation; it supports Structure Definiition and can therefore be used to define a FHIR profile.  However, extensions are by their nature additions to the FHIR specification and will likely require additional code.  
&nbsp;

Code was generated using the XML schema taken from the FHIR specification.  This schema(s) cam be found in the model directory.

    model/fhir-codegen-xsd  

This project accomodates the differences between FHIR's XML and JSON serializations.  

This project maintains its source code in two locations:  

1. Code written to perform the accomodation (mentioned above)
2. Code generated by EMF from the schema(s).  

    src/main/java  
    gen/main/java  

If one is new to EMF,  one should be advised that EMF uses factories as opposed to constructors to instantiate its objects.
