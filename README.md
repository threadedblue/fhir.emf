# fhir.emf

## A full implemtation of the FHIR 4.0.1 specification built using EMF (eclipse modeling framework).  
&nbsp;

This project is intended to be used as a data model.  A likely use case might be as the model component of a webservice.  
&nbsp;

Because this is a full, complete implementation; it supports Structure Definiition and can therefore be used to define a [FHIR profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#5.1.0).  However, [extensions](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#api) are by their nature additions to the FHIR specification and will likely require additional code.  
&nbsp;

Code is generated using the [XML schema](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/xml.html#schema) taken from the FHIR specification.  This schema(s) can be found in the model directory.

    model/fhir-codegen-xsd  

fhir.emf accomodates the differences between FHIR's XML and JSON serializations.  Without these accomodations, de/serialization to XML would be conformant but JSON would be non-conformant.

Source code is maintained in two locations:  

1. Code written to perform the accomodation (mentioned above)
2. Code generated by EMF from the schema(s).  

    src/main/java  
    gen/main/java  

If one is new to EMF, one should be advised that EMF uses factories as opposed to constructors to instantiate its objects.  Other than that EMF obects can be used as if they were Java Beans.
